      "bout Git-Flow.\nThanks for the suggestions. What mental image does \"low\" evoke? I'm not sure I see the association. Low like in \"low level\" or something else?\nHow about \"split\"? Perhaps \"Split Diff Conflict\" or \"Split Conflicts\" or \"Split Merging\"?\n---\nAwesome! That looks exactly right. Thank you for making that screenshot; I added it to the post. I don't understand that sentence either but now I want to do some code-diving to see how they're setting this up. This is the first tool aside from mine that I've seen do this. Very cool. Thanks again.\n---\nYou are not supposed to diff LOCAL against REMOTE; they are there just for reference.\nYou are supposed to edit MERGED, and resolve the conflicts there. Yes, that requires editing conflict markers by hand.\nIn all mergetools you are supposed to edit the conflict markers.\nIn theory you could configure git mergetool to automatically remove the conflict markers, but you would need to choose which code to leave (local, remote, or base), which in my experience vary on every \"merge\".\nI prefer to choose chunk by chunk.\n---\nWeird. The first image in the post shows vimdiff with the markers (bottom pane).\n---\nExamples of low that strike a mental image: \"low effort\", \"Low Fi\", \"low profile\". And yes, even \"low level\". There's a connotation of \"good\" or \"efficient\" there. I'm not sure \"split <something>\" is snappy or attractive, or alluding to good or efficient or better or quicker.\n---\nYou are welcome, If this helps you, you can ask in magit's gitter and ask the guys there. They are always happy to help!\n---\nIn all mergetools you are supposed to edit the conflict markers.\n\nNah, several of the graphical tools don't show them at all. Conflict markers are just one way to visualize differences.\n\nIn theory you could configure git mergetool to automatically remove the conflict markers\n\nI did! (or as a shell script.)\n\nyou would need to choose which code to leave (local, remote, or base)\n\nI leave those exactly intact because they are very useful as a reference. I instead create two new temporary files (left conflict, and right conflict) and, if the merge is successful, eventually overwrite MERGED with the result.\n\nI prefer to choose chunk by chunk.\n\nThat's cool. We can still be friends.\n---\nNah, several of the graphical tools don't show them at all.\n\nI mean the scripts in \"/usr/lib/git-core/mergetools/\". All of them pass unedited MERGED. What each tool decides to do with that afterwards is a different story.\n\nI did! (or as a shell script.)\n\nNo, you created a separate tool. I mean modify git mergetool itself.\n\nI leave those exactly intact because they are very useful as a reference.\n\nNot true. I looked at your code. You have two versions of MERGED, both with markers removed.\n\nThe left pane is MERGED with all markers removed, except the equivalent of the \"local\" side.\nThe right pane is MERGED with all markers removed, except the equivalent of the \"remote\" side.\n\n\nThat's cool. We can still be friends.\n\nFriends don't let friends remove conflict markers :p\n---\nNo, you created a separate tool. I mean modify git mergetool itself.\n\nI feel like we're splitting hairs here. The shell script changes you submitted to the mailing list are almost identical to the shell script in my original implementation, except I don't overwrite LOCAL or REMOTE. But you are right that it would be useful to do this upstream in order to influence the approach downstream mergetools take.\n\nAll of them pass unedited MERGED. What each tool decides to do with that afterwards is a different story.\n[...]\nYou have two versions of MERGED, both with markers removed.\n\nLook again. Neither one of my implementations modify MERGED, LOCAL, REMOTE, or BASE. They both pass all four of those files, unedited, to vimdiff. The plugin then splits MERGED as two unsaved buffers, and the shell script creates two, new temporary files.\n\nThe left pane is MERGED with all markers removed, except the equivalent of the \"local\" side.\n\nNot quite. The \"left\" side of MERGED isn't the same thing as LOCAL. They're not equivalent which is the main point. LOCAL is the state of the file before the merge.\n\nFriends don't let friends remove conflict markers :p\n\nIn that case think of it not as removing the conflict markers but rather displaying them in a different way. We're still friends.\n---\nThe shell script changes you submitted to the mailing list are almost identical to the shell script in my original implementation, except I don't overwrite LOCAL or REMOTE.\n\nYou don't use LOCAL or REMOTE.\n\nBut you are right that it would be useful to do this upstream in order to influence the approach downstream mergetools take.\n\nThat's the point. This way all other mergetools would benefit.\n\nThey both pass all four of those files, unedited, to vimdiff.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you modify the file or not; you modify the buffer, so the user is presented with a modified version of MERGED without the markers.\n\nThe \"left\" side of MERGED isn't the same thing as LOCAL.\n\nI know they are not, but with my patch they are.\nDo you know how to try my patch?\n---\nYou don't use LOCAL or REMOTE.\n[...]\nDo you know how to try my patch?\n\nYes I know how. However I do use LOCAL and REMOTE and so your patch is a worse version of what I'm already using and it would be a worse upstream mergetool for everyone.\nThe blog post mentions why LOCAL and REMOTE are useful in addition to a split MERGED. The diffconflicts plugin accepts LOCAL and REMOTE as arguments in order to display them in a new tabpage on demand.\n\nwith my patch [the] \"left\" side of MERGED [is] the same thing as LOCAL.\n\nThat makes things worse because we already have LOCAL and we already have the left side of MERGED. We don't need two copies of the same result. It would be nice to have both a copy of the file before the merge and a copy of the file after the conflict resolution. I'm not advocating for replacing LOCAL; I'm advocating for not including it in the default diff or during the manual resolution step.\nWe may be talking past each other a bit so this is probably a good place to pause. We're friends and I owe you a beer at the next non-pandemic'd Vim conference for a deep conversation and for getting a dialog going upstream.\nCheers.\n---\nHowever I do use LOCAL and REMOTE\n\nDo you? Your blog post doesn't mention how to view those files.\n\nyour patch is a worse version of what I'm already using and it would be a worse upstream mergetool for everyone.\n\nName one problem.\n\nThat makes things worse because we already have LOCAL and we already have the left side of MERGED.\n\nYou have the left side of MERGED. The rest of the world doesn't.\n---\nCool project (and thanks for the props)!\nQuestion for you (I don't often get to talk to people who think deeply about diffing \\^_\\^): What is the utility of a three-way diff when resolving conflicts?\nI've always been puzzled by the popularity of those tools. I completely appreciate a three-way diff when trying to understand the history that led up to the conflict, of course -- both authors started from BASE, authorA makes changes in LOCAL, authorB makes changes in REMOTE and seeing all three versions helps to understand the individual intents that lead to the conflict. But that's very much a read-only, data collection step for me. (That's why that opt-in three-way tab in diffconflicts is read-only.) Often the resolution is that I want some combination of LOCAL and REMOTE, or occasionally only LOCAL or REMOTE, but I can't think of a time where I've wanted to disregard both and go back to BASE.\nThree-way diffing tools are certainly popular though so I often wonder if I'm the crazy one or if it's everyone else. :-D  If you made it this far past my wall o' text, I'd be interested to hear what utility you see/use that I might be missing.\n---\nHow would this be different from vim-fugitive as a merge-tool?\n---\nOut of curiosity, how does it compare to splice?\n---\nDefinitely a lot of configuration, and now I'm hitting an error that I can't find a resolution to:\n\"File does not have conflict markers.\"\n... when I do indeed have conflict markers. Could my markers be misconfigured? Maybe it's a 2-way/3-way compatibility difference?\nEDIT: but FYI the readme is well formatted, informative & readable. A lot of configuration is sometimes necessary for things like this, especially when wanting it to work \"seamlessly\" in different contexts, like from git with \"git mergetool\".\n---\nfriendly suggestion: use gifs/video to illustrate the features.\n---\n[deleted]\n---\nI'll use it next time I hit a merge conflict and let you know what I think :P\n---\nmark, was just thinking to start using vim as mergetool!\n---\nWhat color scheme are you using in your screenshots?\n---\nHello, \"whiteinge\". Thank you for your \"diffconflicts\" project, which I've used as an inspiration and a baseline.\n&#x200B;\nActually, your reasoning about value of 2-way vs 3-way diff was something that makes me stop and think about how I deal with a conflicts. Your idea clicks me - most time we're using either \"ours\" or \"theirs\" side, of mix thereof to resolve a conflict, and occasionally I need to review their common base just to get deeper insight on why two versions diverge. That's it.\nI've been using conventional 3-way diff merge tools for all my professional career, and there were some inconveniences which I had to accept in absence of alternatives.\n- with 3 vertical splits layout, each split becomes too narrow, code piles up, lines get wrapped or horizontal scroll appears.\n- conflict markers, I hade editing them manually.\n&#x200B;\nMy personal preference of GUI tool is - https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/.\n&#x200B;\nIt has 3 split layout, with `MERGED` in the middle, `ours` to the left, and `theirs` to the right. `MERGED` file have conflict markers already removed in favour of picking up `base` version.  So its \"ours | base/MERGED | theirs\" layout. Plus, it highlights only merge conflicts, not all diffs. Usually, your active split is the middle one, where you can review base version, and pick either `ours` or `theirs` from the sides. I'm using <Ctrl/Cmd - Up/Down> to jump between conflicts, and <Ctrl/Cmd - Right/Left> to choose resolution side.\nRegarding non sufficient split width, in DiffMerge I have my font size = 10pt as a workaround. Surely, in terminal in Vim, I'm not going to toggle between font sizes as I enter and leave merge mode, but for DiffMerge that works.\nAs you can see, DiffMerge is halfway between your ideas and regular tools, which show HEAD, MERGE_HEAD and MERGED file with raw conflict markers.\nThese days, I'm in process of switching to Vim from VSCode, so Vim would be my console-based merge tool, whereas DiffMerge would still back me up as a GUI tool.\nFrom \\~/.gitconfig:\n[merge]\ntool = vim_mergetool\nguitool = diffmerge\n&#x200B;\nBoth tools are at hand:\n$ git mergetool # launch Vim\n$ git mergetool -g # launch DiffMerge\n---\nSo, what vim-figutive does (and any similar solution):  \n\nIt opens 3 vertical splits, with $MERGED file in the middle, and HEAD and MERGE_HEAD revisions to the left and to the right. In Vim, when there're 3 buffers marked with \":diffthis\", it highlights all possible diffs between those files, rather than highlighting only unresolved conflict. Personally, it distracts me, as it shows all diffs between HEAD,MERGE_HEAD and MERGED file, and I want to focus on unresolved conflicts only.\nMERGED file has raw conflict markers unprocessed. If you want to see common-base, you need to parse \"||||||| base\" and \"======\" delimiters manually with your eyes. Also, in all but simple merge conflict scenarios, you would have to edit those conflict markers manually  \n\nThis plugin takes another approach. Instead of comparing MERGED file simply to HEAD(LOCAL) and MERGE_HEAD(REMOTE) revisions, it parses conflict markers in $MERGED file and extracts base/ours/theirs conflict side. Then it takes \"ours\" and \"theirs\" versions and do 2-way diff comparison.\nPros are:\n\nIt optimistically picks up \"ours\" side of conflict. You don't have to deal with and edit conflict markers directly.\nConflict resolution starts where automatic \"git merge-file\" gives up. You have diffs and highlighting present only for merge conflicts, not for any possible diff between HEAD, MERGE_HEAD and MERGED file, as vim-fugitive does.  \n\nSo I'd say this approach is similar to what https://github.com/whiteinge/diffconflicts does, rather than what vim-fugitive \":Gdiff\" does. This plugin was inspired by \"whiteinge/diffcoflicts\", but goes farther with extra features (see readme). And indeed, it is flexible enough to replicate either diffconflicts, vim-fugitive, or regular vimdiff, or adapt to your personal habits.\n---\nSeems that I've missed \"splice\" somehow while exploring existing solutions. Would give it a try, if I had time. Vim takes a lot of free time, BTW. It's the endless configuration loop. :-)  \nQuick look at the readme makes me a bit nervous though, since I'm using \"figutive\" a lot.\n&#x200B;\n\nSplice and Fugitive do not play well together. If you try to use Splice as a git mergetool while you have Fugitive installed it may segfault Vim, even if you're not using any Fugitive features.\n\n&#x200B;\n---\nHm, regarding configuration, that's not too many. See minimal example in readme, and maybe some key mappings, if you'd like. Plus \".gitconfig\", if you're going to run as \"git mergetool\", but that's optional.\nlet g:mergetool_layout = 'mr' \nlet g:mergetool_prefer_revision = 'local'  \nYes, there are a lot of info/text in readme, describing different scenarios, but all that's optional, you can start with simple configuration as in the snippet above. And then adjust various options, if you need more power/customization.  \nRegarding conflict markers, make sure that they are in the \"diff3\" style, like this. Common base marker \"||||||\" is mandatory.\n\" &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n\" ours/local revision\n\" ||||||| base\n\" common base revision\n\" =======\n\" theirs/remote revision\n\" &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feature\n&#x200B;\nIf you only have two sides of a conflict - `ours` and `theirs`, make configure GIT to use diff3 for conflict style. Please, read \"Assumptions\" section at the bottom of the readme.  \n[merge]\nconflictStyle = diff3\nIf that's not the case, and your conflict markers looks right, could you please share a sample file? I would check from my side. Maybe something wrong with my regular expressions.\n&#x200B;\n---\nYeah, thanks, good point. \"Monosnap\" screenshot tool I'm using can record videos/gifs, but I don't like it. Need to find some alternative or maybe use screencast recording app. Will give it a try next time.\n---\nSeems that you want something like this: http://take.ms/WBIz7  \nIt's not supported out of the box right now, but it's possible to implement. For now, just navigate to `base` split, and run. Don't use \":diffoff\", so options like \"scrollbind\" and \"cursorbind\" are not reset.  \nset nodiff  \nIf you have syntax highlighting off by default for diffs, you can turn it on:\nset syntax=on\n---\nhttps://draculatheme.com/vim/ with some minor adjustments.  \nPlus, I have \"set syntax = off\" to disable normal syntax highlighting when window is in diff mode.  \nAlso, I changed styles for highlight groups for DiffText and DiffChange. \n\" Do not highlight changed line, highlight only changed text within a line\nhi! DiffText term=NONE ctermfg=215 ctermbg=233 cterm=NONE guifg=#FFB86C guibg=#14141a gui=NONE\nhi! link DiffChange NONE\nhi! clear DiffChange\n&#x200B;\n---\nThanks for typing up your thoughts. :-)\n---\nI'm using following regexps.\nlet s:markers = { \n\\ 'ours': '^&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ', \n\\ 'theirs': '^&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ', \n\\ 'base': '^||||||| ', \n\\ 'delimiter': '^=======\\r\\?$' }  \nAnd here's the function performing a check.\nhttps://github.com/samoshkin/vim-mergetool/blob/e5433357577d6292e886b9952cabac91213a07ca/autoload/mergetool.vim#L284-L290\n---\nOk, yes, I've got a MWE for you:\nHere is a very important base.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod\ntempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua. At\nvero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum.

At\nvero eos et accusam et justo duo dolores et ea rebum. Stet clita kasd gubergren,\nno sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\n\nFor this, if I run:\n    :MergetoolStart\nI still get the error.\nQuick suggestion: I tend to be able to navigate these sorts of things quite well -- you've done some great documentation, but its entry-point is very difficult. \nAs someone who definitely wants to try out your plugin, I already bring pre-existing knowledge of: diff3-styled markers VS ours/theirs, git to the object db level, vimrc global vars, vim splits, autoload VS plugin dir split, vendor-ing vim plugins, etc. I could just be screwing something simple up, but I think the fact that I go above & beyond to the point where I'm simulating a minimal working example of a git repo w/ a merge-conflict, and still have no idea what the app actually looks like, is indicative of a problem with your README. I think you should have a facepalm-stupid \"Getting Started\" section before you have an Overview breakdown as well-detailed as yours is. I had to go a couple hundred lines down to even get to the point of: Even w/o configuring my git config, how can I just use this in vim on a merge-conflicting file? (i.e. :MergeToolStart) \nI love that you included all that you did, including the key-binding, but the entry-point is just too side-winding if any issue is encountered, as I have. \nThe lowest hanging fruit to make better use of all the documentation work you put in, in my humble opinion, would be to put a simpler section with the \"this is how it should work for 99% of the users\" before getting into edge cases & optimizations, and then have an ASCII-CAST of that simple workflow.\nI've been interested anyways in better leveraging vim for viewing & resolving merge-conflicts, so I'll eventually figure out the issue, and look forwards to digesting the detailed considerations you've had. But I would imagine most people will give up at first error, even without looking to resolve it, let alone having to dig or talk to the maintainer to resolve it.\nCheers :)\n---\n@tlitd, I've covered your use case, and implemented this feature. Thank for interesting idea, I like it.\nSee details on how to use https://github.com/samoshkin/vim-mergetool#advanced-layout-customization\n---\nThank for your response. I agree that readme has a lot of info, so I will move some sort of \"minimal working example\" section to the top of the readme.   \nRegarding your example, I tried that, and it works fine on my local machine. \n&#x200B;\nI would ask you to create an issue on github, and attach or share a link to file verbatim as is. I think it might be due to line endings, and when I copy-paste the snippet from reddit comment, I lose them. Please also tell what kind of Vim you are using (terminal, GUI vim) and what are your OS?  \nCould you also try to run vim with this minimal vimrc, so we cut any other stuff possible interfering.  \nset nocompatible\nfiletype plugin indent on\n\" or whatever plugin manager you're using\ncall plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')   \nPlug 'samoshkin/vim-mergetool' \ncall plug#end()  \nlet g:mergetool_layout = 'mr'\nlet g:mergetool_prefer_revision = 'local'  \nRun vim as:\nvim -u &lt;path_to_vimrc&gt; -N  \nLet's continue this discussion inside Github issue.\n---\n@Redstonefreedom\nI've refactored readme. Moved TL;DR section to the top. And introduced separate error message when file includes conflict markers, but not in diff3 style.\n---\n"
