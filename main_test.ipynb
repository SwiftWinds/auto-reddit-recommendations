      "acing LOCAL; I'm advocating for not including it in the default diff or during the manual resolution step.\nWe may be talking past each other a bit so this is probably a good place to pause. We're friends and I owe you a beer at the next non-pandemic'd Vim conference for a deep conversation and for getting a dialog going upstream.\nCheers.\n---\nHowever I do use LOCAL and REMOTE\n\nDo you? Your blog post doesn't mention how to view those files.\n\nyour patch is a worse version of what I'm already using and it would be a worse upstream mergetool for everyone.\n\nName one problem.\n\nThat makes things worse because we already have LOCAL and we already have the left side of MERGED.\n\nYou have the left side of MERGED. The rest of the world doesn't.\n---\nCool project (and thanks for the props)!\nQuestion for you (I don't often get to talk to people who think deeply about diffing \\^_\\^): What is the utility of a three-way diff when resolving conflicts?\nI've always been puzzled by the popularity of those tools. I completely appreciate a three-way diff when trying to understand the history that led up to the conflict, of course -- both authors started from BASE, authorA makes changes in LOCAL, authorB makes changes in REMOTE and seeing all three versions helps to understand the individual intents that lead to the conflict. But that's very much a read-only, data collection step for me. (That's why that opt-in three-way tab in diffconflicts is read-only.) Often the resolution is that I want some combination of LOCAL and REMOTE, or occasionally only LOCAL or REMOTE, but I can't think of a time where I've wanted to disregard both and go back to BASE.\nThree-way diffing tools are certainly popular though so I often wonder if I'm the crazy one or if it's everyone else. :-D  If you made it this far past my wall o' text, I'd be interested to hear what utility you see/use that I might be missing.\n---\nHow would this be different from vim-fugitive as a merge-tool?\n---\nOut of curiosity, how does it compare to splice?\n---\nDefinitely a lot of configuration, and now I'm hitting an error that I can't find a resolution to:\n\"File does not have conflict markers.\"\n... when I do indeed have conflict markers. Could my markers be misconfigured? Maybe it's a 2-way/3-way compatibility difference?\nEDIT: but FYI the readme is well formatted, informative & readable. A lot of configuration is sometimes necessary for things like this, especially when wanting it to work \"seamlessly\" in different contexts, like from git with \"git mergetool\".\n---\nfriendly suggestion: use gifs/video to illustrate the features.\n---\n[deleted]\n---\nI'll use it next time I hit a merge conflict and let you know what I think :P\n---\nmark, was just thinking to start using vim as mergetool!\n---\nWhat color scheme are you using in your screenshots?\n---\nHello, \"whiteinge\". Thank you for your \"diffconflicts\" project, which I've used as an inspiration and a baseline.\n&#x200B;\nActually, your reasoning about value of 2-way vs 3-way diff was something that makes me stop and think about how I deal with a conflicts. Your idea clicks me - most time we're using either \"ours\" or \"theirs\" side, of mix thereof to resolve a conflict, and occasionally I need to review their common base just to get deeper insight on why two versions diverge. That's it.\nI've been using conventional 3-way diff merge tools for all my professional career, and there were some inconveniences which I had to accept in absence of alternatives.\n- with 3 vertical splits layout, each split becomes too narrow, code piles up, lines get wrapped or horizontal scroll appears.\n- conflict markers, I hade editing them manually.\n&#x200B;\nMy personal preference of GUI tool is - https://sourcegear.com/diffmerge/.\n&#x200B;\nIt has 3 split layout, with `MERGED` in the middle, `ours` to the left, and `theirs` to the right. `MERGED` file have conflict markers already removed in favour of picking up `base` version.  So its \"ours | base/MERGED | theirs\" layout. Plus, it highlights only merge conflicts, not all diffs. Usually, your active split is the middle one, where you can review base version, and pick either `ours` or `theirs` from the sides. I'm using <Ctrl/Cmd - Up/Down> to jump between conflicts, and <Ctrl/Cmd - Right/Left> to choose resolution side.\nRegarding non sufficient split width, in DiffMerge I have my font size = 10pt as a workaround. Surely, in terminal in Vim, I'm not going to toggle between font sizes as I enter and leave merge mode, but for DiffMerge that works.\nAs you can see, DiffMerge is halfway between your ideas and regular tools, which show HEAD, MERGE_HEAD and MERGED file with raw conflict markers.\nThese days, I'm in process of switching to Vim from VSCode, so Vim would be my console-based merge tool, whereas DiffMerge would still back me up as a GUI tool.\nFrom \\~/.gitconfig:\n[merge]\ntool = vim_mergetool\nguitool = diffmerge\n&#x200B;\nBoth tools are at hand:\n$ git mergetool # launch Vim\n$ git mergetool -g # launch DiffMerge\n---\nSo, what vim-figutive does (and any similar solution):  \n\nIt opens 3 vertical splits, with $MERGED file in the middle, and HEAD and MERGE_HEAD revisions to the left and to the right. In Vim, when there're 3 buffers marked with \":diffthis\", it highlights all possible diffs between those files, rather than highlighting only unresolved conflict. Personally, it distracts me, as it shows all diffs between HEAD,MERGE_HEAD and MERGED file, and I want to focus on unresolved conflicts only.\nMERGED file has raw conflict markers unprocessed. If you want to see common-base, you need to parse \"||||||| base\" and \"======\" delimiters manually with your eyes. Also, in all but simple merge conflict scenarios, you would have to edit those conflict markers manually  \n\nThis plugin takes another approach. Instead of comparing MERGED file simply to HEAD(LOCAL) and MERGE_HEAD(REMOTE) revisions, it parses conflict markers in $MERGED file and extracts base/ours/theirs conflict side. Then it takes \"ours\" and \"theirs\" versions and do 2-way diff comparison.\nPros are:\n\nIt optimistically picks up \"ours\" side of conflict. You don't have to deal with and edit conflict markers directly.\nConflict resolution starts where automatic \"git merge-file\" gives up. You have diffs and highlighting present only for merge conflicts, not for any possible diff between HEAD, MERGE_HEAD and MERGED file, as vim-fugitive does.  \n\nSo I'd say this approach is similar to what https://github.com/whiteinge/diffconflicts does, rather than what vim-fugitive \":Gdiff\" does. This plugin was inspired by \"whiteinge/diffcoflicts\", but goes farther with extra features (see readme). And indeed, it is flexible enough to replicate either diffconflicts, vim-fugitive, or regular vimdiff, or adapt to your personal habits.\n---\nSeems that I've missed \"splice\" somehow while exploring existing solutions. Would give it a try, if I had time. Vim takes a lot of free time, BTW. It's the endless configuration loop. :-)  \nQuick look at the readme makes me a bit nervous though, since I'm using \"figutive\" a lot.\n&#x200B;\n\nSplice and Fugitive do not play well together. If you try to use Splice as a git mergetool while you have Fugitive installed it may segfault Vim, even if you're not using any Fugitive features.\n\n&#x200B;\n---\nHm, regarding configuration, that's not too many. See minimal example in readme, and maybe some key mappings, if you'd like. Plus \".gitconfig\", if you're going to run as \"git mergetool\", but that's optional.\nlet g:mergetool_layout = 'mr' \nlet g:mergetool_prefer_revision = 'local'  \nYes, there are a lot of info/text in readme, describing different scenarios, but all that's optional, you can start with simple configuration as in the snippet above. And then adjust various options, if you need more power/customization.  \nRegarding conflict markers, make sure that they are in the \"diff3\" style, like this. Common base marker \"||||||\" is mandatory.\n\" &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\n\" ours/local revision\n\" ||||||| base\n\" common base revision\n\" =======\n\" theirs/remote revision\n\" &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; feature\n&#x200B;\nIf you only have two sides of a conflict - `ours` and `theirs`, make configure GIT to use diff3 for conflict style. Please, read \"Assumptions\" section at the bottom of the readme.  \n[merge]\nconflictStyle = diff3\nIf that's not the case, and your conflict markers looks right, could you please share a sample file? I would check from my side. Maybe something wrong with my regular expressions.\n&#x200B;\n---\nYeah, thanks, good point. \"Monosnap\" screenshot tool I'm using can record videos/gifs, but I don't like it. Need to find some alternative or maybe use screencast recording app. Will give it a try next time.\n---\nSeems that you want something like this: http://take.ms/WBIz7  \nIt's not supported out of the box right now, but it's possible to implement. For now, just navigate to `base` split, and run. Don't use \":diffoff\", so options like \"scrollbind\" and \"cursorbind\" are not reset.  \nset nodiff  \nIf you have syntax highlighting off by default for diffs, you can turn it on:\nset syntax=on\n---\nhttps://draculatheme.com/vim/ with some minor adjustments.  \nPlus, I have \"set syntax = off\" to disable normal syntax highlighting when window is in diff mode.  \nAlso, I changed styles for highlight groups for DiffText and DiffChange. \n\" Do not highlight changed line, highlight only changed text within a line\nhi! DiffText term=NONE ctermfg=215 ctermbg=233 cterm=NONE guifg=#FFB86C guibg=#14141a gui=NONE\nhi! link DiffChange NONE\nhi! clear DiffChange\n&#x200B;\n---\nThanks for typing up your thoughts. :-)\n---\nI'm using following regexps.\nlet s:markers = { \n\\ 'ours': '^&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ', \n\\ 'theirs': '^&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ', \n\\ 'base': '^||||||| ', \n\\ 'delimiter': '^=======\\r\\?$' }  \nAnd here's the function performing a check.\nhttps://github.com/samoshkin/vim-mergetool/blob/e5433357577d6292e886b9952cabac91213a07ca/autoload/mergetool.vim#L284-L290\n---\nOk, yes, I've got a MWE for you:\nHere is a very important base.\n\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod\ntempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.

Stet clita kasd gubergren,\nno sea takimata sanctus est Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.\n\nFor this, if I run:\n    :MergetoolStart\nI still get the error.\nQuick suggestion: I tend to be able to navigate these sorts of things quite well -- you've done some great documentation, but its entry-point is very difficult. \nAs someone who definitely wants to try out your plugin, I already bring pre-existing knowledge of: diff3-styled markers VS ours/theirs, git to the object db level, vimrc global vars, vim splits, autoload VS plugin dir split, vendor-ing vim plugins, etc. I could just be screwing something simple up, but I think the fact that I go above & beyond to the point where I'm simulating a minimal working example of a git repo w/ a merge-conflict, and still have no idea what the app actually looks like, is indicative of a problem with your README. I think you should have a facepalm-stupid \"Getting Started\" section before you have an Overview breakdown as well-detailed as yours is. I had to go a couple hundred lines down to even get to the point of: Even w/o configuring my git config, how can I just use this in vim on a merge-conflicting file? (i.e. :MergeToolStart) \nI love that you included all that you did, including the key-binding, but the entry-point is just too side-winding if any issue is encountered, as I have. \nThe lowest hanging fruit to make better use of all the documentation work you put in, in my humble opinion, would be to put a simpler section with the \"this is how it should work for 99% of the users\" before getting into edge cases & optimizations, and then have an ASCII-CAST of that simple workflow.\nI've been interested anyways in better leveraging vim for viewing & resolving merge-conflicts, so I'll eventually figure out the issue, and look forwards to digesting the detailed considerations you've had. But I would imagine most people will give up at first error, even without looking to resolve it, let alone having to dig or talk to the maintainer to resolve it.\nCheers :)\n---\n@tlitd, I've covered your use case, and implemented this feature. Thank for interesting idea, I like it.\nSee details on how to use https://github.com/samoshkin/vim-mergetool#advanced-layout-customization\n---\nThank for your response. I agree that readme has a lot of info, so I will move some sort of \"minimal working example\" section to the top of the readme.   \nRegarding your example, I tried that, and it works fine on my local machine. \n&#x200B;\nI would ask you to create an issue on github, and attach or share a link to file verbatim as is. I think it might be due to line endings, and when I copy-paste the snippet from reddit comment, I lose them. Please also tell what kind of Vim you are using (terminal, GUI vim) and what are your OS?  \nCould you also try to run vim with this minimal vimrc, so we cut any other stuff possible interfering.  \nset nocompatible\nfiletype plugin indent on\n\" or whatever plugin manager you're using\ncall plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')   \nPlug 'samoshkin/vim-mergetool' \ncall plug#end()  \nlet g:mergetool_layout = 'mr'\nlet g:mergetool_prefer_revision = 'local'  \nRun vim as:\nvim -u &lt;path_to_vimrc&gt; -N  \nLet's continue this discussion inside Github issue.\n---\n@Redstonefreedom\nI've refactored readme. Moved TL;DR section to the top. And introduced separate error message when file includes conflict markers, but not in diff3 style.\n---\n[deleted]\n---\nkdiff3 is pretty good and it runs on windows and linux.\n---\nThe best merge tool I have used is Araxis Merge (http://araxis.com/merge/). It is not free, but it is a pretty amazing. I have not seen anything come close to matching it.\n---\nany way to make emacs do this?\n---\nHa! You should try Kompare.\n---\nSo far though, it looks like there's only one method of diffing. The world needs, not 10,000 guis wrapped around the diff command-line utility, but more ways to diff. \n(more general-purpose background on diff algorithms: one two.\n---\nYeah, meld's a nice piece of kit. Great to see a new release - I thought this project had fizzled.\n---\nI really like vsdiff that comes with SlickEdit.\n---\nFor those using Windows, I highly recommend WinMerge.\nhttp://winmerge.org/downloads/index.php\n---\nI like Meld but there is one feature that WinMerge has that I haven’t been able to reproduce in Meld. WinMerge has keyboard shortcuts for everything, so you do something like alt-down, alt left (can’t recall the exact commands) and that will go to the next diff and replace the right file with the left file. In Meld you have (or at least as far as I know) to do the same but with the mouse which makes it slower.\n---\nI have not seen anything so far to beat vim -D, especially if you also use folding and diff motion commands.\n---\nNeat approach to deprecating old functionality (like XPath):\n\"With jQuery 1.2, as with the jQuery 1.1 release, a backwards compatibility plugin will be provided. Thus, if you wish to continue using these particular techniques, you’ll be able to use that plugin and continue doing so.\"\n---\nIn particular, the diff view looks very much like FileMerge's main view.\n---\nI haven't tried Meld (I guess that should be a hint to me to shut up, but...) but from the screenshots it looks very similar to FileMerge.app which I use and love.\nIn fact, it's the only reason I fire up svnX (OS X gui svn client), since svnX will pop both sides of the svn diff into FileMerge.app for me.\n---\nFileMerge is very nice indeed.  It's also available as the command 'opendiff'.  \nI often use it with the darcs, as in \"darcs diff --diff-command 'opendiff %1 %2'\", so much so that I wonder why I don't just set a global default for it...\n---\n+1 for FileMerge.app. Just about as sexy as such a tool could  possibly be. :P\n---\nI went to figure out how to use FileMerge with Git, and happily discovered that the Mac distribution of Git already has it built-in, just type \"git mergetool\". Yay for built-in tools.\n---\nThank you.  Didn't know it existed.\n---\nHow is it better than meld?\n---\nYea.. can it do visual diff for git auto magically?\nhttp://blog.sarathonline.com/2009/02/use-meld-as-git-diff-gui-viewer.html\n---\nNot as prettily, but Ediff, which has been built into Emacs as long as I can remember, has all of the functionality.\n---\nfwiw I'm an Emacs newbie and I don't care for ediff. It seems somewhat arcane to me, and I usually like odd software. stick with meld... unless you love doing everything in Emacs.\n---\nIf I only didn't detest KDE so much...\n---\nWell, it seems it has exactly the same features as meld, just with a different UI toolkit.\nCare to elaborate?\nBTW, it's not strictly a visual diff tool, but I just love SCM and it has mostly replaced meld for me. It's the only Java program I have found worth using (apart from Eclipse - which has pretty good visual diff tools too).\nOh... I just noticed it's not available because of those BitKeeper dumbasses. Fuck them.\n---\nCan WinMerge do intra-line diff highlighting?\n---\nWith DirDiff Plugin, it can.\n---\n...and the comparison reminds you just how ugly GTK is.  It's amazing, after so many years, how much it still looks like \"my first GUI\" with antialiased fonts.\n---\nIf you'd like to fire up FileMerge to view a diff without the need to run svnX, take a look at http://www.friday.com/bbum/2005/08/01/using-filemerge-with-subversion/.\n---\nThat will be fixed in KDE 4.\n---\nI use Kompare all the time and I when I tried Meld last month I thought it seemed very unfinished. I like how Kompare uses kioslaves so I can diff a file in svn with a file on a remote server just as easily as I can diff two local files.\nIt runs fine on Gnome.\n---\nIt can!  It's a pretty nice product, I have been using it for about 3 years now and it makes publishing web updates and synching folders and such so simple.  It's also open-source.\n---\nOr you could netedit two directories in two vertical windows, and do a :windo diffthis command. Presto!\n---\nIt's an old GTK theme. Personally, I find the modern GTK themes kinder on the eye than Aqua, if not as sexy.\nMeld's a great app that goes a bit further than just file compare. It's got enough VCS integration to review changes in a directory tree and selectively commit files. It also has syntax highlighting, if you desire. I've found it perfect for code reviews.\n---\nAh thank you for that link; that is exactly what I want to do.\n---\nA classic joke, but still funny.\n---\nUnlikely\n---\nIt shouldn't be hard.\nSimply the GUI a lot (i.e., remove all that clutter).\nMake windows remember their position and and size (hello Konqueror, it's 2007!).\nInclude a non-ugly theme (Plastik's windows look great, but the rest is awful; I don't want everything sticking in my face; it looks like a Mac with all those bubbles, only much much more ugly).\n---\n\"Old\" hardly excuses the really obvious ugliness, e.g. inadequate space between text and \"X\" buttons.  But the functionality sounds sweet (almost as much as Emacs's ediff).  I assumed it was just \"diff with an ugly gui.\"\n---\n\"Old\" hardly excuses the really obvious ugliness, e.g. inadequate space between text and \"X\" buttons.\n\nYou realize there are dozens of GTK themes right? This one happens to suck, but someones obviously still likes it. You don't, neither do I. Oh well, that's why there's a choice.\nhttp://blue.bikeshed.com/\n---\n"
